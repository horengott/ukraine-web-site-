# ukraine-web-site-

This website was developed by me with the aim of helping Ukrainian refugees in Europe and to popularize Ukraine.

I would like to focus on the interactive map of Europe (its code is in the file index.html and styles.css). To create the map I used svg elements and created interactivity using Javascript code.

There are also other html and css files for the remaining tabs of the website.
